# Ripon Viewbook

This repository hosts the code for the WordPress theme used on [viewbook.ripon.edu](http://viewbook.ripon.edu) - the Ripon College Viewbook. We wanted to expose the theme to the open source community to show how we created it, and give interested developers a means of contributing to the project. Pull requests are welcome, so don't hesitate to contribute if you see something that can be improved or needs fixing!

The project uses Grunt to compile and minify both the CSS and Javascript files. We used Sass to enable robust CSS editing and to help make the site responsive. Once you clone the project, you'll need to have nodejs installed. Navigate to the theme folder and run `npm install` to install all the necessary development modules and plugins - then simply use the `grunt` command to start watching any and all changes to CSS or Javascript. Then, you're ready to code!

If you find bugs and aren't sure how to fix them, feel free to submit an issue here on Github and we'll respond as best we can. Thanks in advance for your contributions and help making this project great!
